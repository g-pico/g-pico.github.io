            <p>After two years of cooking, g-Pico has finally launched, and we couldn't be more excited!</p>
            <p>As engineers in Taiwan, we've often found ourselves bogged down by routine tasks, searching for ways to improve
            efficiency. Through data collection and analysis in our daily work, we began to truly appreciate the power
            of automation. This sparked a passion in us to develop and promote automated solutions that could make
            life easier for everyone.</p>

            <p>Starting with no knowledge of Python, we've spent the past two
             years working relentlessly to build and refine the g-Pico system.
              Today, we're thrilled to see it finally ready to launch, opening 
              doors to new possibilities in automation.
            </p>

            <p>We are filled with hope for the future and eager to share the 
            benefits of automation with others. Our goal is to help everyone 
            lead more efficient and fulfilling lives through technology. This 
            is just the beginning!
            </p>

            <p>We are deeply grateful to everyone who has helped us along the 
            way, as well as the online resources that supported us. We will try 
            our best to make people's lives better.
